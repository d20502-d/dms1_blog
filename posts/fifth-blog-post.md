# draft of task 1

1. Based on your storyboard, produce a draft of your video portrait for Assignment 1. It doesn't have to be the finished version, but it should be pretty close.

2. Upload this draft to your YouTube or Vimeo account, post it to your blog, and write a blog post that discusses your process in producing this draft.

3. Prepare a brief written introduction to your work. It should explain your general concept and intentions with the work in a clear, concise, and professional manner. 

4. Place this introduction into the description of your draft on YouTube or Vimeo. Double-check that the link is ready for sharing in class during the next session.
