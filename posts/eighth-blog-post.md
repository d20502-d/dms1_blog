2. Using the skills that you have built up in Illustrator so far, begin to translate your chosen thumbnail sketches into the Flat Design style, in Illustrator. 

3. Choose one of your icon designs, and duplicate it three times. Use the tools in Illustrator to create a colour design for each duplication, based on the palettes discussed in the lecture: one monochromatic, one analogous, one complementary (or split complementary), and one triadic. 

4. Repeat this process for at least three more icons: you should end up with at least 16 total colour variations.

5. Upload all of these designs to your blog, and reflect on which colour schemes you think might work best for your concept, and why.
