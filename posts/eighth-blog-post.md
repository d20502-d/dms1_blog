# tracing activity

geometric forms:

![](240819/5.png)


When drawing this artwork into geometric forms, many detail parts of the drawing will need to be remove. I found that it is important to choose and keep the most significant part of the original drawing. I made these decisions by trying a few different part that i think is important and compare which of them came out the best.


1. Download the Edward Hopper painting examples here Download here. 

2. Choose two of these paintings, and bring them into Illustrator. Using the Pen Tool, trace over one of the paintings using organic forms with the Pen Tool, and trace over the other painting using geometric forms with the Shape Tool.

3. Document and comment on this process on your blog. Part of this task will involve distilling these images down to a group of essential visual qualities, and deciding on which parts of the original paintings you will keep in your tracings, and which you will remove. Discuss specifically how you made these decisions.

1. Watch chapters 4, 6, and 8 of the Illustrator 2024 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos.

2. Using the skills that you have built up in Illustrator so far, begin to translate your chosen thumbnail sketches into the Flat Design style, in Illustrator. 

3. Choose one of your icon designs, and duplicate it three times. Use the tools in Illustrator to create a colour design for each duplication, based on the palettes discussed in the lecture: one monochromatic, one analogous, one complementary (or split complementary), and one triadic. 

4. Repeat this process for at least three more icons: you should end up with at least 16 total colour variations.

5. Upload all of these designs to your blog, and reflect on which colour schemes you think might work best for your concept, and why.

6. Download and install Visual Studio CodeLinks to an external site. in preparation for the next class, if you haven't done so already.
