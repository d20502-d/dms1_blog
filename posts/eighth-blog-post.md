# tracing activity

geometric forms:

![](240819/5.png)


When drawing this artwork into geometric forms, many detail parts of the drawing will need to be remove. I found that it is important to choose and keep the most significant part of the original drawing. I made these decisions by trying a few different part that i think is important and compare which of them came out the best.

organic forms:

During the process of drawing this work, i found that organic forms seems to be harder for me because it takes more time for me to get the exact line that i want. For this picture, I remove most of the detail part (for ex. the grass and the detail of the buildings) and keep the light and shadows.


# icon flat design

1. Watch chapters 4, 6, and 8 of the Illustrator 2024 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos.

2. Using the skills that you have built up in Illustrator so far, begin to translate your chosen thumbnail sketches into the Flat Design style, in Illustrator. 

3. Choose one of your icon designs, and duplicate it three times. Use the tools in Illustrator to create a colour design for each duplication, based on the palettes discussed in the lecture: one monochromatic, one analogous, one complementary (or split complementary), and one triadic. 

4. Repeat this process for at least three more icons: you should end up with at least 16 total colour variations.

5. Upload all of these designs to your blog, and reflect on which colour schemes you think might work best for your concept, and why.

6. Download and install Visual Studio CodeLinks to an external site. in preparation for the next class, if you haven't done so already.
