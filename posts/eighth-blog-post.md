# tracing activity

geometric forms:

![](240819/5.png)


When drawing this artwork into geometric forms, many detail parts of the drawing will need to be remove. I found that it is important to choose and keep the most significant part of the original drawing. I made these decisions by trying a few different part that i think is important and compare which of them came out the best.

organic forms:

During the process of drawing this work, i found that organic forms seems to be harder for me because it takes more time for me to get the exact line that i want. For this picture, I remove most of the detail part (for ex. the grass and the detail of the buildings) and keep the light and shadows.
