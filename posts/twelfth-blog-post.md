1. Gather the ideas that you have generated so far, and decide on one project to pursue for Assignment 3.

2. Using the design documents that you generated for your last homework task, and the navigation design concepts explored in class today, block out your environment design in Unity. 

3. Start with basic primitives such as cubes and spheres to establish landmarks, paths, and other spatial design elements. You may also use the terrain tool for outdoor environments. 

4. Work quickly and roughly to ensure that you have a simple greybox prototype for the next class, and so you can start testing and iterating as soon as possible. 

ideas of how to lead the player through the environment:
I will be using the elments and principles of spatial desing to lead the user, also i want to have a light ball that can lead the player to the target area, it only shows the general direction/position -> won't be pointing out how should they go which some games do so by having a navigation line on the ground this also breaks the scene somehow (ugly and seems abrupt) and i want to prevent this to happen.
The reason that i choose to use light ball is because i don't want it to be somthing like an arrow that keep telling player what to do like you must turn left or right at a certain spot and to force player to obey the instructions, i wish that player are able tp discover the scene and explore new possibilities to make it to the end. of course there will be a main path that i want the player to go, the path will use some visual elements that makes it clear to the player that this is the desinged path. Moreover, i want it to be kind of a part of the scene.

details of the light ball:
- leads the player to the target area
- player-centric; always float a few steps beside the player, limited activity range
- also moves depends on the players viewpoint, kinda hard to explain in words it's just like how moon orbits around earth while earth is the player and the light ball is the moon
-> basically act as a compass that always point towards the target location
