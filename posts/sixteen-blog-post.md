# reflection

AT1: Video Edit

I learned that the use of sound can affect audience's interpretation also amplify feelings and emotions, so using appropritae sound can better convey the ideas to the viewers.
In my video, I use chill music to create a sense of relaxation and let the viewers to be in the same pace with me.


AT2: Graphic Icons

The icons are designed for an diary app and the theme "Dream" and "Memory" links with this.
I tried many different color designs to compare which of them came out the best, and through the experimentation, saturation was the thing that changed the most. I found that I'm used to use low saturated color tones and by having more attempts, it shows that some icons appear better using more saturated colors.
The thumbnail sketches was drawn on my ipad and I import it into my desktop and use illustrator to trace out the lines, during this process, some of the lines are deleted because I need to keep the icons united and some tumbnails are too detaled.
I keep the icons unity by trying to maintain the hue at the same level.


AT3: Virtual Environment

I think the working portotype isn't helping much like it doesn't affect much if I skip this process, however it gives me a general idea of the size of each object.
Creating a three dimensional environment is way more complicated than creating a two dimensional environment, because there are a lot more things that will need to be consider when switching from 2D to 3D. For instance, the distance between the objects and the size of the object from close to far.
The virtual camera basically plays the same role for both of my assignment (act as the "eye"). The difference is that for AT1 it is more likely to be my eye; audience can only see that I see. Then for AT3, it is still first person perspective but the players are able to control the "eye" and they are free to discover anything in the environment.
