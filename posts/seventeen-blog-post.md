# reflection

1. Based on your answers to the self reflection questions from the last session, begin to formalise the written components of your folio webpage into a series of paragraphs that will frame your work and progress over the semester in a clear, accessible, and engaging manner. 

2. Gather the quotes, images, and any other material from your blog that you identified as useful during the last homework task, and use them to practice implementing content on Figma. Don't worry too much about the layout or organisation for now.

3. If you haven't already, write a first draft of your artist or designer bio. In tandem with this, focus on how you can use various visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer. Document and comment on this process in a blog post.
