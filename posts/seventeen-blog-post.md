at1 artist statement:


This work is a snapshot/ visual journal of the places, events, and atmospheres that reflect and resonate with me. Each scene is chosen not only for its aesthetic but for the calm it brings, indirectly reflecting "me" also the aspects of my personality and the quiet I find essential. Through this video, I want the audience to join a realm of quiet, where moments unfold slowly, inviting a deep, tranquil focus.
The key moment, a reflection of the street view on the building windows, serves as a metaphor for inner contemplation and connection. As the music's pace flows chillingly and connects with each scene, it creates a sense of harmony and relaxation, drawing the audience into an immersive space where they can experience the things that I find meaningful. Overall, I hope to share a moment of peace and the beauty that can be simply found in daily life through this audio-visual journey.
