1. Watch chapter 8 of the Unity 3D 2023 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos.

2. Based on the playtesting session from today's class, and the principles discussed in the lecture, iterate on your greybox prototype by establishing your approach to proportion, form/void relationships, and other elements of spatial composition.

3. Once the entire environment is roughly blocked out in this fashion, you may steadily replace your primitives with the final assets over the remainder of the project. Ensure that you add appropriate mesh colliders to these assets, as per the above video tutorial.

4. Continue to rigorously document this process on your blog, and iterate on your design document with any changes that you need to make to either your concept or project. Document and justify these changes as you go.
