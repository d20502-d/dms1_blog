# unity

1. Watch chapter 8 of the Unity 3D 2023 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos.

2. Based on the playtesting session from today's class, and the principles discussed in the lecture, iterate on your greybox prototype by establishing your approach to proportion, form/void relationships, and other elements of spatial composition.

3. Once the entire environment is roughly blocked out in this fashion, you may steadily replace your primitives with the final assets over the remainder of the project. Ensure that you add appropriate mesh colliders to these assets, as per the above video tutorial.

4. Continue to rigorously document this process on your blog, and iterate on your design document with any changes that you need to make to either your concept or project. Document and justify these changes as you go.

It spends me a lot of time finding the models that i wanted and i didn't found any of them matches what i want so i ended up using the ones that seems to match closest to what i want and use blender to edit it (and i found that blender is harder than unity, there are soooo much windows and tools which is very unfriendly beginners!!!). although the product is the best that i can make in this limited time, i'm not really statisfied with the result. I also encounter a new problem as a import the model into unity, what i want is to have a tunnel that can goes down to the inside/bottom of the mountain, so the problem is that the mountain will turn transparrent from when the player goes into it. I solve this problem by finding other tunnel routes which is like a pipe and put them inside the mountain so it acts more like what i want. Then the biggest challenge comes, att the bottom of the mountain, i want the player to be able to look up to the top (the mountain is like a volcano with a hole at the top which means that people are able to see the sky at the bottom) and there will be a beam of moonlight shinning down with a shooting star pass by, at this point the the camera will shine black for a second simbolize the action of making a wish and after that there will be a lot of small lightballs surrounding the player and slowly lift the player up to the top of the mountain. So for the sky part, i had to give up because i didn't find out a way to change the sky depending on where the player is at and what i've planned is to have three part of sky changing, the first part is at the prairie and the forest, when player is at the prairie, it is daytime and when as they move closer to the forest the sun starts to set slowly and it became cloudly then when the player is about to enter the cave it becomes night time. The second part is the shooting star scene that i just meintioned above, then the third part is at the mountain top where the sun begins to rise.
