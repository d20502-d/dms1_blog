Storyboard for my blog:

Through editing, I want to convey a sense of relax, quiet, and concentrating which indirectly reflects "me" to the audience. The storyboard was quiet rough but I think it won't be the same as my final product, there might be new stuffs added in order to better convey the things that I want to express.
