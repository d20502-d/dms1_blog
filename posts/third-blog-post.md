# Storyboard

![1](240725)
^30 sec footage


1. Using the template provided on Canvas, or one of your own making, produce a storyboard or storyboards for your Assignment 1 project.

2. You may use screenshots of any footage you've shot so far, or your own illustrations to indicate the composition and movement of shots and visual elements.

3. Upload your storyboard to your blog, along with a discussion of how you will establish and maintain continuity (and/or discontinuity) in your work.

4. Your blog post should also specifically discuss how your approach to editing will contribute to the main theme, concept, action, or emotion you hope to offer the viewer.
