# Icon design website

https://d20502-d-at2-97.deno.dev/


overall, the hardest part of this assignment for me is to think of which sound effect is going t be use for each icons. I spend a lot of time trying different sound effects and see which of them matches best.

the icon i design is for an iphone diary app that allows users to record their daily life.


1. pencil icon: it is the add new entry icon which allows users to add new diary entry
2. message bottle: it is the icon that allows users to review an random message that they've wrote to themselves before that can encourage them
3. check icon: it is used when the users finish editing their entries and they want to post it.
4. user icon: it is the basic setting button which allows users to change their profile info such as their name.
5. setting icon: allows users to change the setting of the app such as the language, font, celsius or fahrenheit, etc...
6. emotion icon: in each diary entry, users can choose to record their emotion of the day
7. featured (stared) icon: to marked the entry that the users think is special
8. calendar icon: allows the users to check what entry they left on each date.
9. location icon: allows the users to record the location in their diary entry.
