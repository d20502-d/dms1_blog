I cannot create a youtube account with the school email so I use another account to create the yt acc. Through this experiment, I tried to use transition between two different scenes and also I learned how to readjust the size of the video. So far, I think i'm a bit slow cuz i'm spending some time figuring out how do i adjust the size of differnt sequence and i think there's still a lot of things that i haven't tried/ discovered yet.
