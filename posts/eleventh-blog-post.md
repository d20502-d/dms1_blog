1. Watch chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Unity 3D 2023 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos. 

2. Brainstorm and develop some ideas for your digital environment for Assignment 3.

3. Develop this material into the first iteration of a simple, top-down map of your environment, produced either traditionally or digitally. This map should show how the user will move through the space from beginning to end, and indicate how the environment itself will gradually evolve over the journey in terms of colour, sound, layout, size, etc. 

4. On this map, mark out the locations of the key moments in this journey, and in a blog post discuss how they will help you to articulate the personal transformation or change that informed your concept. 

5. Based on this map, produce a preliminary list of the assets (3D models, sounds, textures, etc) that will be required for your environment.
