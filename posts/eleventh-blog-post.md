1. Watch chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Unity 3D 2023 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos. 

2. Brainstorm and develop some ideas for your digital environment for Assignment 3.

3. Develop this material into the first iteration of a simple, top-down map of your environment, produced either traditionally or digitally. This map should show how the user will move through the space from beginning to end, and indicate how the environment itself will gradually evolve over the journey in terms of colour, sound, layout, size, etc. 

4. On this map, mark out the locations of the key moments in this journey, and in a blog post discuss how they will help you to articulate the personal transformation or change that informed your concept. 

5. Based on this map, produce a preliminary list of the assets (3D models, sounds, textures, etc) that will be required for your environment.

# Brainstorm
The digital environment that i want to create is related to a event that happens to me which is really significant and plays an important role in my life. This environemnt will be reflecting out my feelings and the state of mind in different stages of this event. The core concept is that we'll need to learn to accept loss and confront separation, our life won't stop so we have to move on eventually, the things that we had undergone will always be in our heart/memory. <br>
There will be 3 main areas with the first area representing the time before the event. The second area will be reflecting from the time that the event happens to the state of mind after the event. The third area will be the stage that has learned to accept loss and separation, as the end is also a new start, this will be at the top of the mountain with sunrise and sea of clouds.

# first iteration
3 main areas

the first area can be split into two parts which is the prairie and the forest <br>
tbe forest part was added when i draw the draft concept out, it seems to be too sudden to change from the prairie to the cave which has the theme of dark, hopeless that appears to be completely opposite from the beautiful prairie that is filled with life and vitality


top of the mountain: had learned to accept loss and separation/ overcome the most difficult part <br>
sunrise: the end is also a new start, sunrises as the night ends <br>
sea of clouds: the future; using the clouds to show that it is unpredictable and full of unknowns <br>
