# Black square

![](240812/1.png)

It was quite easy for the first four design of each label. i spend some time on moving the squares to see if there's any good composition where some came out well and some kinda sucks. However, this is quite interesting and challenging as we are limit to use black squares only.


# Assignment 2

The prompt that appeal me the most is "Dream" and "Memory".

brainstorming concepts:
- experience
- explore
- record
- emotions

Dream:
platform: iphone

rough ideas:
1. new diary entry
2. save memory
3. happy
4. sad
5. fear
6. disgust
7. angry
8. anxious
9. boredom
