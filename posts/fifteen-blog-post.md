1. Ask a friend, family member, classmate or someone else to playtest your work. Give them a set amount of time to explore your environment, and don't give them any instructions about where to go or what to do.  

2. Using a screen recording method of your choice, create a screen recording of their testing of your work. Use this recording to improve your design by looking for elements that may be confusing, overlooked, or otherwise in need of adjustment.

3. Post this recording to your blog, and write a post detailing the testing session, including who your tester was, what the results of the session were, and how the results will inform the design of your project moving forward. 

4. Prepare a test upload on Unity Play, and a survey, if you haven't done so already, ready for testing in the next session. Note that if you are having trouble with 3D sound on Unity Play, you can use the alternate 3D Sound Template package Download 3D Sound Template package. Simply drag in the '3d_sound_template" object, slot the First Person Player into the script, and add an audio clip to the AudioSource.
