# Sound

1. Watch chapter 6 of the Premiere Pro 2022 - 2024 Essential TrainingLinks to an external site. videos. Follow along using audio clips that you have sourced for your own project.

2. Identify a key moment in your planned two minute sequence for Assignment 1: one that the success of the project is likely to depend upon.

3. Write a justification for how you are planning to use sound design and soundtrack to construct this moment. Focus particularly on the relationship between the audio and visual elements. 

4. As part of this discussion, consider the following questions:

  - What is the emotional tone of the broader portrait, and how are your editing choices going to support that tone generally?
  - What does the audience need to understand about the relationship between shots in this moment? What connection are you trying to forge?
  - What sort of rhythm, tempo, or pace are you attempting to establish during this moment? How will your editing produce this?

5. Post your written analysis to your blog, and post an updated version of your storyboard that accounts for the sonic elements of your project.
