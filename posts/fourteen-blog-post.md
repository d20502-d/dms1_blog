At this point of this assignment, i think i encountered many problems and i had to make many changes and concession. Actually it was quite frustrated being unable to create exactly what i wanted but the process of creating this 3d environmednt is still very intersting and engaging. It may be because what i wanted to create is kihd of complex or maybe because i didn't do 3d stuff before, this project is really the one that makes me learn the most from it ><!
