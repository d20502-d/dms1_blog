# thumbnail sketching

1. Post the results of the thumbnail sketching activity to your blog, and comment on which of your alternatives is the most effective, and why.

2. Build from this to produce a series of thumbnail sketches to develop your graphic icons for Assignment 2. You should work quickly and roughly to create at least five thumbnail sketches per icon, for a total of least 45 icon concepts. 

3. Upload these sketches to your blog, and evaluate your work with a post that identifies and comments on the thumbnail sketches that you think are the best for each icon. Justify these choices by commenting on how you applied the elements of design in each case.


practice in class:

it was quite hard to draw a same thing in different ways in a short time. I was struggling when i came to the tenth sketch.


rough sketch of the 9 icons (5 sketches each):

brief idea of the 9 icons but some of them may not be used as the final product cuz i may come up with some better ideas as i generate them into flat design.
